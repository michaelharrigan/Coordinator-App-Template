# Coordinator-App-Template

This repository is a very simple Xcode project template based upon the Coordinator Pattern. 

Instead of going through the hassle of creating the structure every time, you can choose this new template.

## How To Install

1. Clone this repo. 
2. Add the `.xctemplate` file to this `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/` directory.
3. If you don't have that template you will end up in a folder called `Xcode`. That just means we need to create the proper structure for templates. 
    - You will want to create a New Folder in this directory `Xcode` called `Templates`
    - Navigate to that folder and added two folders, `File Templates` & `Project Templates`.
4. Make sure you restart Xcode to see this new template.

## Once You've Opened The Template

You will need to go to your storyboard and give the `ViewController` storyboard a `Storyboard ID` of `ViewController`.

## Run & Enoy!
